[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stellar/stellar-core.svg?branch=auto)](https://travis-ci.org/stellar/stellar-core)

# Note this code is pre-beta. 
It is definitely not ready yet for production.
 
# core

The Core Consensus is basically the same as the Stellar Consensus with one small difference with huge implications:

- The removal of native currency

Implications:

- Transactions are FREE (the fee is always zero)
- Addresses don't need to receive a "createAccount" Transaction before they can be used.
- There is no central authority in charge of giving away native currency.
- The genesis ledger is 100% EMPTY.

# Getting Started

## Warning: Requires Postgres 9.5

You WILL lose sync if you run against an earlier version.

Installation instructions ---> [HERE](https://github.com/buhrmi/core/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
 

 
# stellar-core

Stellar-core is a C++ implementation of the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/src/scp/readme.md) that maintains a local copy of the ledger and syncs with other instances of stellar-core on the network. Learn more by reading the [overview document](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/readme.md).

# Documentation

Documentation of the code's layout and abstractions, as well as for the
functionality available, can be found in
[`./docs`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/tree/master/docs).

# Contributing

We're striving to keep master's history with minimal merge bubbles. To achieve
this, we're asking PRs to be submitted rebased on top of master.

To keep your local repository in a "rebased" state, simply run:

`git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always` *changes the default for all future branches*

`git config --global branch.master.rebase true` *changes the setting for branch master*

note: you may still have to run manual "rebase" commands on your branches to rebase on top of master as you pull changes from upstream.

Code formatting wise, we have a `.clang-format` config file that you should use on modified files.

# Running tests

run tests with:
  `src/stellar-core --test`

run one test with:
  `src/stellar-core --test  testName`

run one test category with:
  `src/stellar-core --test '[categoryName]'`

Categories (or tags) can be combined: AND-ed (by juxtaposition) or OR-ed (by comma-listing).

Tests tagged as [.] or [hide] are not part of the default test test.

# Running tests against postgreSQL

There are two options.  The easiest is to have the test suite just
create a temporary postgreSQL database cluster in /tmp and delete it
after the test.  That will happen by default if you run `make check`.

You can also create a temporary database cluster manually, by running
`./src/test/selftest-pg bash` to get a shell, then running tests
manually.  The advantage of this is that you can examine the database
log in `$PGDATA/pg_log/` after running tests, as well as manually
inspect the database with `psql`.

Finally, you can use an existing database cluster so long as it has
databases named `test0`, `test1`, ..., `test8`, and `test`.  Do set
this up, make sure your `PGHOST` and `PGUSER` environment variables
are appropriately set, then run the following from bash:

    for i in $(seq 0 8) ''; do
        psql -c "create database test$i;"
    done

# Running stress tests
We adopt the convention of tagging a stress-test for subsystem foo as [foo-stress][stress][hide].

Then, running
* `stellar-core --test [stress]` will run all the stress tests,
* `stellar-core --test [foo-stress]` will run the stress tests for subsystem foo alone, and
* neither `stellar-core --test` nor `stellar-core --test [foo]` will run stress tests.
